"The Goo" helps you stick "Things" together in your working environment.

Things include Perl modules, Perl scripts, log files, javascripts, configuration files, database tables, templates etc.

The Goo records a "Trail" as you jump quickly from Thing to Thing in a simple, text-based console. It remembers how you
associate Things in your environment.

Accelerate your work by quickly traversing the Trail of associations between Things.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install


THINGS

Each type of Thing has a ".goo" configuration file. 

The .goo file lists the locations where Things of this type can be found (e.g., directory, database) and the actions that 
can be performed on a Thing (e.g., [E]dit = Editor.pm). 

Perl modules, for example, have a ".pm" suffix so this type of Thing is defined in the pm.goo configuration file. The
pm.goo file includes a list of directory locations where Perl modules can be found and a list of actions that can be
performed on Perl modules. These actions relate to the "action handlers" that carry out the action (e.g., E[X]it =
Exiter.pm).

General action handlers are located in the top-level Goo/ directory (e.g., [Z]one -> Zone.pm) and Thing-specific action
handlers are found in a Goo/Thing/ subdirectory based on suffix. Perl modules, for example, use a special editor ([E]dit =
Goo::Thing::pm::Editor.pm) and the action handler is located in the Goo/Thing/pm directory.
